Q-3) How two-dimensional arrays are represented in memory? 
Also obtain the formula for calculating the address of any element stored in the array, in case of column-major.
A-3) Two-dimensional arrays are typically represented in memory in a row-major or column-major order. In this explanation,
     I'll focus on column-major order, which is commonly used in languages like Fortran.
     In column-major order, elements of the array are stored column by column in memory. This means that consecutive elements of the same column 
     are stored next to each other, and columns are stored one after the other.
     o calculate the memory address of any element in a two-dimensional array stored in column-major order, you can use
     Address=BaseAddress+(ColumnIndexÃ—ColumnStride)+RowIndex
