Q-13) Determine the formula to find the address location of an element in three-dimensional arrays, 
suppose each element takes four bytes of space and elements are stored in row-major order.
A-13) To determine the address location of an element in a three-dimensional array stored in row-major order,
where each element takes four bytes of space, you can use the following formula:
address = base_address + (i * (num_columns * num_rows) + j * num_columns + k) * size_of_element
where: 
•	base_address is the memory address of the first element of the array.
•	i, j, and k are the indices of the element in the three dimensions (row, column, depth).
•	num_columns represents the number of columns in each row.
•	num_rows represents the number of rows.
•	size_of_element is the size of each element in bytes.
Explanation:
•	i * (num_columns * num_rows) calculates the offset due to the rows. Each row consists of num_columns * num_rows elements.
•	j * num_columns calculates the offset due to the columns within a row. Each column consists of num_columns elements.
•	k represents the offset within a single column.
•	The entire expression calculates the total offset in terms of the number of elements.
•	Multiplying by size_of_element converts the offset from the number of elements to bytes, since each element takes up size_of_element bytes.
This formula accounts for the row-major order, where elements are stored sequentially by rows, followed by columns, and then depths.
