Q-2) What are the sparse matrices? Give an example.
A-2) 
--> Sparse matrices are matrices in which most of the elements are zero. 
    In contrast to dense matrices, which store all elements regardless of value, sparse matrices only store the non-zero elements, along with their indices.

--> Sparse matrices are often used in situations where the matrix is large and mostly empty, to save memory and computational resources. 
     They are commonly encountered in scientific computing, graph theory, and various other fields.
