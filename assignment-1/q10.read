Q-10)  Draw a linked list and vector representation of the following sparse matrix.
A-10) ïƒ¨	Linked List Representation:
We can use a linked list to represent non-zero elements along with their positions (row and column). 
Each node in the linked list contains the value, row index, column index, and a pointer to the next node.
Linked List:
Head -> (1, 2, 12) -> (2, 2, 11) -> (3, 1, 9)
Here, the values are associated with their positions in the matrix.
Vector Representation:
We can use a vector to store a tuple of (row, column, value) for each non-zero element in the matrix.
Vector:
[(1, 2, 12), (2, 2, 11), (3, 1, 9)]
This vector represents the non-zero elements along with their positions in the matrix.
Keep in mind that these representations are suitable for sparse matrices where the majority of the elements are zero,
and we focus on storing only the non-zero elements to save memory.
