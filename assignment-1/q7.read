Q- 7) Write an algorithm to count the common elements of two one-dimensional arrays.
A- 7)	ALGORITHEM
Input:
•	 Two one-dimensional arrays, array1 and array2, each of size n1 and n2 respectively.
Output:
•	Count of common elements between array1 and array2.
Steps:
1)  Initialize a variable commonCount to 0 (to keep track of the count of common elements).
2)  Loop through each element (element1) in array1:
     a. Inner loop through each element (element2) in array2:
     b.  If element1 is equal to element2, increment commonCount by 1. 
3. Print or return the value of commoncount as the result.
