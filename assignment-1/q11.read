Q-11) Explain the application areas of the array with a suitable example.
A-11) Arrays are fundamental data structures that find applications across various domains in computer science and programming. 
Here are some key application areas of arrays along with examples:

Data Storage:
Arrays are commonly used to store collections of data elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.
Example: Storing a list of student grades in an array int grades[10].

Data Structures:
Arrays serve as the underlying structure for many other data structures like stacks, queues, heaps, and hash tables.
Example: Implementing a stack using an array to store elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access behavior.

Algorithms:
Arrays are essential in various algorithms such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
Example: Implementing the quicksort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

Multimedia Processing:
Arrays are used to represent and manipulate multimedia data such as images, audio, and video.
Example: Storing pixel values of an image in a two-dimensional array for image processing tasks like filtering and transformation.

Simulation and Modeling:
Arrays are employed to represent and manipulate simulation data in fields like physics, engineering, and economics.
Example: Simulating a physical system by storing time-series data in an array for analysis and visualization.

Graphical Applications:
Arrays are used to represent graphical data, such as vertices in computer graphics and game development.
Example: Storing the coordinates of vertices in a polygon to render it on a screen.
